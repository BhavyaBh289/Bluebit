## How to Run

1. Open the HTML file (`index.html`) in a web browser.

2. Optionally, use a local development server for more complex applications:
   - **Python:**
     ```bash
     python -m http.server
     ```
     Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

   - **Node.js:**
     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     http-server
     ```
     Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080`.

3. Check the browser console for debugging (press `F12` or right-click and select "Inspect").
